2. Select your preferred language from the top-right dropdown
3. Write your code in the left panel
4. View results in the right panel

### Language-Specific Features

#### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Full ES2022+ support
- TypeScript compilation
- Real-time error checking

> **Windows Users**: TypeScript support on Windows has limitations with modern ES2016+ features (arrow functions, template literals, const, let, etc.). For full ES2016+ support, please install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). The app will automatically use Node.js when available, otherwise it will use the built-in JavaScript engine with limited feature support.

#### Go

- Full Go standard library
- Fast compilation and execution

#### SQL/PostgreSQL

- Connect to PostgreSQL databases
- Execute SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE queries
- View results in formatted tables
- Connection status monitoring

### Tips

- Autosave and auto code execution
- Resize panels by dragging the divider
- Switch languages anytime without losing your code
- Check the connection status for PostgreSQL in the language switcher
- Get data about speed of code and queries execution
